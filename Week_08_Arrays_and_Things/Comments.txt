Andy 8/9/2016 - I focused mostly on the layout/content, box sizes, and margins/paddings. I did some resizing of fonts for the Index but did not focus much on that for the Blog. I left my notes in my code so I can understand it if/when I come back to it later. I understand I would remove these self-notes prior to going live with the site/code. Thanks!
